# QA-Metrics


These are the metrics to tackle enormous defect leakages due to too frequent patch/hotfix/minor/major releases in startups.

Although these look, otherwise obvious, metrics, but implimenting in startup is teadeous task.
Starups run by individual responsibilities more, than by processes.

These metrics are easy for well matured product company, to implement, track, trace and recalibrate the QA process.
